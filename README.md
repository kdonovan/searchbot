# Searchbot

Searchbot is an adapter to various business listing websites, allowing searches to be automated and filters applied. It was created to scratch the very, very annoying itch of existing sites offering email alerts without any of the filters you'd actually care about if you were, you know, actually looking to buy a business.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'searchbot', github: 'kdonovan/searchbot'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle


## Usage

Check the specs for intended usage.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
